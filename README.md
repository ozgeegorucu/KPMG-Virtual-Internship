# Approach for New Customer Data analysis
This project aims to analyze the data of new customers based on several factors such as age distribution, bike purchase, job industry, and number of cars owned. The following findings were discovered:

# Age Distribution
New customers are predominantly from the age group of 30-40, followed by 40-50.

# Bike Purchase
The data shows that the age group 30-40 has a high count in terms of bike purchases in the last 3 years, with a slightly greater female ratio.

# Job Industry
The top three profit-generating industries for new customers are financial services, manufacturing, and health, followed by retail and property.

# Number of Cars Owned
New South Wales has the biggest potential since the number of people who own vehicles is nearly equal to the number of individuals who do not own cars, indicating that there is room for value customers there.

# Customer Classification – Targeting High Value Customers
Based on the above findings, the project recommends targeting high-value customers who meet the following criteria:

Aged between 30 – 40
Mostly female compared to male
Working in Financial Service, Manufacturing, and Health
Currently living in New South Wales and/or Victoria.
By targeting these high-value customers, the project aims to increase customer acquisition and improve profitability for the business.
